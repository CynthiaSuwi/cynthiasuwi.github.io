Hello, all. üôÇ

And thus, GSoC is about to end. I've been finishing up the coding on my project and working with my mentors. Tuesday, August 14th 16:00 UTC is Final Evaluation deadline.

My project on ‚Äú[Automatic Speech Recognition for Speech-to-Text on Chinese](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5284664500027392)‚Äù was developed under [Red Hen Lab](http://www.redhenlab.org/). In this project, a Speech-to-Text conversion engine on Chinese is established, resulting in a working application.

During 12 weeks, I developed my project on [GitHub://ASR-for-Chinese-Pipeline](https://github.com/CynthiaSuwi/ASR-for-Chinese-Pipeline). If you like, you can go through the project' [README](https://github.com/CynthiaSuwi/ASR-for-Chinese-Pipeline/blob/master/README.md). Here, I summarized the work done by me.

*Please note that this is just a summary of what I did during this summer. If you like, you can read my weekly blogs [here](https://cynthiasuwi.github.io/posts/) for better understanding.*
