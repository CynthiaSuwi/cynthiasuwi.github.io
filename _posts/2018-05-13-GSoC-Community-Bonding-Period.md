# Start of GSoC 2018: Community Bonding Period

## Community Bonding Period: April 24â€Šâ€”â€ŠMay 14, 2018
I started with GSoC on 24 April. I made contact with my mentors. I came to know that my primary mentor is Huijian Lv, littleowen and Mark Turner. I am talking to them since then. They also created a slack team for this yearâ€™s GSoC projects.

### CWRU HPC Accounts
All students under Red Hen Lab were given access to HPC cluster at CWRU. Prof. Mark Turner asked us some details and our RSA public keys. In one or two days, our accounts were ready. Initially, I faced some problems while making a login into HPC cluster (password problems ðŸ˜‰). But after some days, that problem also resolved.

It turns out that the RedCat cluster is going away at the end of this month. So we finally use the Rider cluster (rider.case.edu) instead.

### Chinese pipeline
To go to a particular day, issue "day" with the date or the number of days ago:
{% highlight shell %}
day + 5
day - 30
{% endhighlight %}

To navigate between dates, use:
{% highlight shell %}
module load ffmpeg
for DAY in {08..31} ; do day 2018â€“01-$DAY ; for FIL in *_CN_*.txt ; do echo $FIL ; grep 'DUR|' $FIL ; ffprobe ${FIL%.*}.mp4 ; done ; done
{% endhighlight %}

View all the files related to Chinese Pipeline:
{% highlight shell %}
mbt8@dtn1 /mnt/rds/redhen01/redhen/tv/2018/2018â€“01 $ ls */*_CN_* -d
{% endhighlight %}

### Deep Speech 2
My GSoC project is an extension to DeepSpeech2 on PaddlePaddle.
- The first work in the future for me is to understand and run existing code in my system: Practice on DeepSpeech2 Project using PaddlePaddle.
- Another work which should be accomplished is to download the training data from the server.

## Conclusion
Now the bonding period is over, and coding has started. I am strictly following my timeline, as proposed by me during GSoC application period (given on my proposal). I will be talking about the first week very soon. The first week gets over on 21 May. Till then, happy coding and cheers.
