# Google Summer of Coding Week 4&5

## First Evaluations and Updated Chinese Pipeline

Just after the 4th week, it was the time for the first GSoC evaluations. Therefore, week 4 is mainly about document our progress on Chinese pipeline.

I establish a [Github repository for GSoC](https://github.com/CynthiaSuwi/ASR-for-Chinese-Pipeline) other than this blog. I've included our work these days in the projectâ€™s README. If you like, you can have a look.

## DeepSpeech2 Paper Review

Our Chinese language model based on [Baidu's Deep Speech 2 paper](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v48/amodei16.pdf), with [PaddlePaddle](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Paddle) platform. Since we will directly use the released [Mandarin LM Large](http://cloud.dlnel.org/filepub/?uuid=245d02bb-cd01-4ebe-b079-b97be864ec37) as our language model, it is important for us to fully understand its operation principle.

**Waiting to be updated**

## Conclusion

This wraps up my report for the 4th week. I will be writing about the 5th week soon. Thank you for reading. ðŸ˜€
